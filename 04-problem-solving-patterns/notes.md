# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counters

- uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- useful pattern to avoid nested loops / quadratic time
- break down arrays into objects key/values to access comparisons rather than looping over each element several times

## Multiple Pointers

- goal is to move towards beginning/middle/end of values based on a certain condition
- keep track of index/position by creating pointers
- very efficient and minimal space complexity when values sorted
