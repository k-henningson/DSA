# Problem Solving Approach

## Strategies

### Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Explore Concrete Examples

1. Start simple
2. Progress to complex
3. Test empty inputs
4. Test invalid inputs

### Break It Down

1. Write out the steps you need to take #comments

### Solve/Simplify

1. Ignore the difficulty you can't solve temporarily
2. Solve the parts you can complete
3. Incorporate difficult parts back in

### Look Back and Refactor

1. Improve performance
2. How intuitive is your solution / readability
3. How have other people solved this problem? Learn from their solutions.
4. Reflect
