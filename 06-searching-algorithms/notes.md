# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

- visit one item at a time, checking every single item
- best case scenario but rare is 0(1), usually O(n) time complexity

### Examples

- indexOf
- includes
- find
- findIndex

## Binary Search

- eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- array has to be sorted
- divide and conquer
- best case scenario 0(1), usually 0(log n) time complexity

## Naive String Search

- checks for all character of the main string to the pattern
